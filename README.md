Hello. I am akyp, a mechanical keyboard enthusiast since early 2020. After accumulating a number of keyboards I began exploring the possibility of designing my own keyboards. Between work and preparing migration to another country, I managed to teach myself designing PCBs and cases. Thus in 2022, my first project -- the O17, was born. Shortly afterwards it was followed by the Ashley. Our latest project being the Desire65.

While the thought of selling my own designs is alluring, I just don't possess the soft skills to do that.  With limited time, I would rather be making new designs than handling logistics.  This is why I have created this website to document my work rather than selling it.

If you are a vendor and is interested in selling my designs, you are more than welcome to start a conversation by emailing me at support@archerkeyboard.com.
