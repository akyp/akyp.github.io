Hello. I am akyp, a mechanical keyboard enthusiast since early 2020. After accumulating a number of keyboards I began exploring the possibility of designing my own keyboards. Between work and preparing migration to another country, I managed to teach myself designing PCBs and cases. Thus in 2022, my first project -- the [O17](./o17), was born. Shortly afterwards it was followed by the [Ashley](./ashley) and its [Autumn Edition](./ashley-autumn-edition). Our latest project being the [Desire65](./desire65).

While the thought of selling my own designs is alluring, I just don't possess the soft skills to do that.  With limited time, I would rather be making new designs than handling logistics.  This is why I have created this website to document my work rather than selling it.

If you are a vendor and is interested in selling my designs, you are more than welcome to start a conversation by emailing me at support@archerkeyboard.com.

This GitHub repository was created to replicate the contents at https://archerkeyboard.com, which I own and was hosted somewhere, until I got tired of the convoluted process of renewing the SSL certificate every year and abandoned it for good.
